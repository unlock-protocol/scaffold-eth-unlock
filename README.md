> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ ENS.YOLO

## Description
ENS.YOLO is a fun experiment at onboarding new people to web3. To get started purchase an ENS NFT. Approve ENS.YOLO contract for transactions on both of ENS smart contracts (Registry and Registrar) and yolo some ETH which will be received by the person who claims the ens. Airdrop them a key so they are the only ones able to claim it.

ENS.YOLO integrates the Unlock Protocol, which enables the possibility of users gamifying the claim process and creating different experiences for their friends(or community) such as treasure hunts, contests, etc.

## How it works

🔏 Deploy a free lock smart contract using [Unlock](https://app.unlock-protocol.com)

📝 Get a `.eth` ENS name and head over to YOLO ENS tab and provide the requested info 

💼 Approve ENS.YOLO smart contract for transactions on ENSRegistry and BaseRegistrarImplementation smart contracts (2 Approve transactions)

📱 Airdrop key(s) to recepient(s). In case of multiple keys, the first user with a valid claim key to `claim` gets the ENS and the accompanying ETH. 

👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 Creators can Cancel YOLO anytime provided it has not been claimed.

## 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork ENS YOLO:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unlock-protocol/scaffold-eth-unlock.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-unlock
git checkout ensyolo
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-unlock
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-unlock
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

🛠 Edit your componets `YoloEns.jsx, ClaimEns.jsx, CancelEns.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src/components/yolo`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
